<p><strong>It's Alive Excercise</strong></p>
</div>
            

There, life would be <strong id="highlight">easy, simple.</strong>
All the servitudes,all the problems brought by material existence would find a <strong id="highlight">natural solution.</strong>
A cleaning lady would come <strong id="highlight">every morning.</strong> Every fortnight, </div>

    <ul id="coffee">
		<li>wine</li>
		<li>oil</li>
		<li>sugar</li>
	</ul>     
 <div>would be delivered.</div>
 <br>



<div>
There would be a huge bright kitchen with </div>


    <ul id="shine">
    	<li>blue tiles decorated with heraldic emblems</li>
        <li>three china plates decorated with yellow arabesques in metallic paint</li>
        <li> cupboards everywhere</li>
        <li> a handsome whitewood table in the  middle with stools and bench-seats.</li>
    </ul>





<div>
    It would be pleasant to come and sit there, <strong id="highlight">every</strong> morning, <strong id="highlight">after</strong> a shower, scarcely dressed. On  the table there would be</div>

    <ul id="breakfast">
    	<li>a sizable stoneware butter dish</li>
    	<li> jars of marmalade</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>toast</li>
        <li>grapefruit cut in two</li>
        </ul>
    

<div>

 It would be early. It would be <strong id="highlight">May,</strong> the <strong id="highlight">start</strong> of a <strong id="highlight">long summers day</strong>.They would </div>

    <ol id="routine">
    	<li>open the mail</li>
        <li>open the newspapers</li>
        <li>light their first cigarette</li>
        <li>They would go out</li>
    </ol>


<div>
 Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning. They would meet</div>

	<ol id="evening">
		<li>for lunch a sandwich or steak, according to their mood;</li>
		<li> they would have coffee at a street cafe</li>
		<li> then go home, on foot, slowly</li>
    </ol>
 




<div>
Their flat would rarely be tidy, <strong id="highlight">but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm.</strong>They would hardly bother themselves with it: <strong id="highlight">they would live in it.</strong> The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be </div>

	<ul id="comfort">
		<li>an established fact</li>
		<li> a datum</li>
		<li> a state of their nature</li>
	</ul>


<div>

 Their attention would be elsewhere: </div>
 	
 		<ul id="focused">
 			<li>on the book they would open</li>
 			<li>on the text they would draft</li>
 			<li>on the record they would listen to</li>
 			<li> on their dialogue engaged afresh each day</li>
 	    </ul>
    

 	
 <div>

 They would work for a long while. Then they would </div>


	<ol id="night">
		<li>dine or go out for a dinner</li>
	    <li>see old friends</li>
	    <li>they would walk together</li>
	</ol>


<div>
 Sometimes it would seem to them<br>that a whole life could be led <strong id="highlight">harmoniously</strong><br> between these<strong id="highlight"> book-lined walls,</strong><br>amongst these objects so perfectly <strong id="highlight">domesticated</strong></p> <br><p>that they would have ended up <strong id="highlight">believing</strong><br> these <strong id="highlight"> bright, soft, simple</strong> and <strong id="highlight">beautiful things</strong><br> had only ever been made<strong id="highlight"> for their sole use.</strong></p><br><p>But they <strong id="highlight">would not</strong> feel enslaved by them:<br><strong id="highlight">on some days,they would go off on a chance adventure.</strong><br><strong id="highlight">No plan seemed impossible to them.</strong></p> <br><p>They <strong id="highlight">would not know rancour,</strong> or <strong id="highlight">bitterness</strong> or <strong id="highlight">envy.</p></strong></p><br><p>For their <strong id="highlight">means and desires</strong> would <strong id="highlight">always match</strong> in <strong id="highlight">all ways.</strong><br> They would call this balance <strong id="highlight">happiness</strong> and,<br>with their <strong id="highlight">freedom</strong>,with their <strong id="highlight">wisdom</strong> and their <strong id="highlight">culture,</strong><br> they would know how to <strong id="highlight">retain</strong><br>and to <strong id="highlight">reveal it</strong> in <strong id="highlight">every moment</strong> of their living,<br> <p><strong id="highlight">together.</strong></p>
