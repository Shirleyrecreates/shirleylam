<p><br> <p>There, life would be easy,simple.</p> <p>All the servitudes,all the problems brought </p> <p> by material existence would find a natural solution.</p> <p>A cleaning lady would come every morning. Every fortnight,</p> <p> wine, oil, and sugar would be delivered. There would be a huge </p> <p> bright kitchen with blue tiles decorated with heraldic emblems,</p> <p> three china plates decorated with yellow arabesques in metallic </p> <p> paint, cupboards everywhere, a handsome whitewood table in the </p> <p> middle with stools and bench-seats. It would be pleasant to come </p> <p> and sit there, every morning, after a shower, scarcely dressed. On </p> <p> the table there would be a sizable stoneware butter dish, jars of </p> <p>marmalade, honey, toast, grapefruit cut in two. It would be </p> <p> early. It would be May, the start of a long summers day.</p></p> 

<p><p>They would open the mail, they would open the <p> </p>newspapers. They would light their first <p>cigarette. They would go </p> <p>out. Their work would </p> <p>keep them busy for a few </p> <p> hours only, in the morning. They would </p> <p>meet for lunch, a sandwich or steak, according to their mood;</p> they would have coffee at a street cafe and then go home, on foot, slowly.</p>

<p><p>Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm. </p> <p> They would hardly bother themselves with it: they would live in it. The comfort of their </p> <p> surroundings would seem to them to be an established fact, a datum, a state of their nature.</p> <p> Their attention would be elsewhere: on the book they would open, on the text they would draft, </p> <p> on the record they would listen to, on their dialogue engaged afresh each day. They would work for </p> <p>a long while. Then they would dine, or got out for a dinner; they would see old friends; they would </p> walk together.</p>

<p><p>Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these book-lined</p> <p> walls, amongst these objects so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, </p> <p>soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for their sole use. But they wouldnâ€™t feel enslaved </p> by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance adventure. No plan seemed impossible to them. They would <p> not know rancour, or bitterness or envy. For their means and desires would always match in all ways. They would </p> <p>call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to </p>retain and to reveal it in every moment of their living, together.</p>
