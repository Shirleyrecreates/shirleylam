<p>Hello viewers! My name is Shirley; I am 23 and a Hunter transfer student. I did my associate in Early Childhood Education and now I am adventuring into emerging media studies. I am hoping to learn how to edit photos and video content using  Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator to enhance my media products. I would like to create a blog page where I can expand and build toward other media sites. I want to create an expressive outlet for people who vibe with me to come together.</p>


<p>In my free time, I enjoy working with children in an after school program. This year I had the opportunity to work with a class of twenty-one kindergarteners and it's just an eye-opening and refreshing experience seeing things from the newer generations' point of view. It is such a rewarding experience for me.</p>


<p>I also like drawing and sketching, my favorite medium is charcoal. Other times I spend it strolling around media platforms for ideas I would like to integrate into my work. I really enjoy the process it takes to get to the finished product rather than the finished product itself. The joy and excitement to see your work come alive from two dimensional to three dimensional. From adding shades, blurring, and color, it brings out and animates an object. Watching DIY content and speed art contents on Youtube and Instagram like those are very satisfying and eye capturing.</p>


<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> I have a YouTube channel where I do mostly singing covers for entertainment purposes. I would like to start doing some lifestyle content in the future. My photography and editing skills are mediocre at best so I would like to use this class to learn and create better content for my viewers and self. I started this channel because it was something I've wanted to do for a long time but was too afraid to dabble into it.</p>


<p>I am a really anxious person who has been suffering from anxiety from such a young age so it is really hard for me to say what I want to say when I want to say it. With creating content I want, I get to express myself and I have the say of what I put out there. With this platform, I've learned to be more open to expressing myself and taking constructive criticism, using it to learn and build upon other projects for the future. My goal is to inspire people who are like me that's struggling and tell them it's okay, to keep striving because I am.</p>
