<p><strong>It's Alive Excercise</strong></p>
<div>

<p>There, life would be <strong>easy, simple.</strong>
All the servitudes,all the problems brought by material existence would find a <strong>natural solution.</strong>
A cleaning lady would come <strong>every morning.</strong> Every fortnight, 
<div>
    <ul>
		<li>wine</li>
		<li>oil</li>
		<li>sugar</li>
	</ul>         
 would be delivered.</p>

</div>

<p>There would be a huge bright kitchen with 

<div>
    <ul>
    	<li>blue tiles decorated with heraldic emblems</li>
        <li>three china plates decorated with yellow arabesques in metallic paint</li>
        <li> cupboards everywhere</li>
        <li> a handsome whitewood table in the  middle with stools and bench-seats.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</p>

<p>It would be pleasant to come and sit there, <strong>every</strong> morning, <strong>after</strong> a shower, scarcely dressed. On  the table there would be
<div>
    <ul>
    	<li>a sizable stoneware butter dish</li>
    	<li> jars of marmalade</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>toast</li>
        <li>grapefruit cut in two</li>
        </ul>
</div>
 It would be early. It would be <strong>May,</strong> the <strong>start</strong> of a <strong>long summers day</strong>.</p> 

<p>They would
<div>
    <ol>
    	<li>open the mail</li>
        <li>open the newspapers</li>
        <li>light their first cigarette</li>
        <li>They would go out</li>
    </ol>

<p> Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning. They would meet
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>for lunch a sandwich or steak, according to their mood;</li>
		<li> they would have coffee at a street cafe</li>
		<li> then go home, on foot, slowly</li>
    </ol>
 </div>

</p>

<p>Their flat would rarely be tidy, <strong>but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm.</strong>They would hardly bother themselves with it: <strong>they would live in it.</strong> The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be 
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>an established fact</li>
		<li> a datum</li>
		<li> a state of their nature</li>
	</ul>
<div>

 <p>Their attention would be elsewhere: 
 	<div>
 		<ul>
 			<li>on the book they would open</li>
 			<li>on the text they would draft</li>
 			<li>on the record they would listen to</li>
 			<li> on their dialogue engaged afresh each day</li>
 	    </ul>

 	</div>
 </p>

 <p>They would work for a long while. Then they would 

<div>
	<ol>
		<li>dine or go out for a dinner</li>
	    <li>see old friends</li>
	    <li>they would walk together</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<p> Sometimes it would seem to them<br>that a whole life could be led <strong>harmoniously</strong><br> between these<strong> book-lined walls,</strong><br>amongst these objects so perfectly <strong>domesticated</strong></p> <br><p>that they would have ended up <strong>believing</strong><br> these <strong> bright, soft, simple</strong> and <strong>beautiful things</strong><br> had only ever been made<strong> for their sole use.</strong></p><br><p>But they <strong>would not</strong> feel enslaved by them:<br><strong>on some days,they would go off on a chance adventure.</strong><br><strong>No plan seemed impossible to them.</strong></p> <br>They <strong>would not know rancour,</strong> or <strong>bitterness</strong> or <strong>envy.</strong></p><br><p>For their <strong>means and desires</strong> would <strong>always match</strong> in <strong>all ways.</strong><br> They would call this balance <strong>happiness</strong> and,<br>with their <strong>freedom</strong>,with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>culture,</strong><br> they would know how to <strong>retain</strong><br>and to <strong>reveal it</strong> in <strong>every moment</strong> of their living,<br> <p><strong>together.</strong></p>
